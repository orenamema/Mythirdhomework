Introduction

This is a password generator website that can be accessed at index.html.In this assignment I was asked to create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
The user will be prompted to choose from the following password criteria:


Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters)
Character type:
Special characters 
Numeric characters
Lowercase characters
Uppercase characters 

To create this application I have used several ressources online as well as from the in class material. I have used console.log for the prompts as well as if statements to make sure the conditions were met

There are links:

index.html
style.css
script.js
